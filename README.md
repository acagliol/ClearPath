## MVP

### Alejo’s Vision:
- Trucker configurations
- Route optimization
- Subreddits - create forums/threads to allow user communications

### MVP for Smart Trucking Navigation System

#### Essential Features:
- **Truck-Specific Navigation:**
  - Input truck dimensions and weight.
  - Calculate routes that avoid low-clearance bridges, weight-restricted zones, and narrow roads.
  - Turn-by-turn navigation with real-time traffic updates.
- **Real-Time Hazard Reporting:**
  - Allow drivers to report road hazards such as accidents, closures, and severe weather.
  - Display these reports on the map with a simple user voting system for accuracy.
- **Parking and Fuel Suggestions:**
  - Show nearby parking spots filtered by amenities (e.g., showers, security, dining).
  - Provide live fuel price updates at nearby stations.
- **Fleet Manager Dashboard - hierarchical:**
  - Enable fleet managers to monitor routes and track driver progress in real-time.
  - Display basic metrics like delays and route changes.
- **Community Communication:**
  - Include a basic chat feature for drivers to share updates and advice.
- **Weather Alerts:**
  - Provide notifications about severe weather conditions along the route.
  - Radar-view map of weather conditions (rain, ice/sleet, snow, etc).
- **Multi-Stop Route Planning:**
  - Allow drivers to plan routes with multiple stops, optimizing for time or distance or both.
- **Basic Data Storage:**
  - Save favorite locations like fuel stops and parking areas for quick access.
  - Other users’ historical storage and trends.

#### Excluded Features for MVP:
- Advanced sensor integration (roof-mounted sensors).
- Predictive maintenance analytics.
- Electric vehicle charging station locators.
- Leaderboards or rewards systems.
- Advanced fleet analytics (e.g., fuel efficiency trends).
- Complex integrations with external platforms.
